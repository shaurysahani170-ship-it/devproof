# DevProof

DevProof is a buildathon project that connects engineering students with real-world
problems from local businesses and generates reviewed proof-of-work certificates.

---

## Problem
Many engineering students struggle to get jobs due to lack of real-world experience.
At the same time, local businesses have real technical problems but limited resources.

There is no simple system that connects these two and provides trusted validation.

---

## Solution
DevProof enables a simple validation loop:

- Local businesses submit real problems
- Engineering students solve them
- Businesses review and rate the solutions
- A proof-of-work certificate is generated with real feedback

This gives students real experience and businesses usable solutions.

---

## Demo Flow (Built)
1. Business submits a real-world problem
2. Student submits a solution
3. Business reviews the solution (rating + feedback)
4. System generates a proof-of-work certificate

---

## Key Feature
- Lightweight business review ensures certificates reflect real-world quality,
  not just task completion.

---

## Current Status
Functional demo prototype built during buildathon.
Focused on validating the core experience loop.
